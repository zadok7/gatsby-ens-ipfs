Blockchain may be a term that many have heard of recently as its technology branches out into the main stream. The most common misconception is that blockchain is just about cryptocurrencies. Although cryptocurrencies are built on the blockchain, there is so much more to web3 and the blockchain technologies behind the model. The term web3 summarized the birth or shift of the Internet into decentralized and highly secure peer to peer networks. Economies at scale are possible with many advantages over the traditional web2 model. Economies do not only mean financial economies, but rather economies that enable decentralized communities. The following list of resources may be helpful in learning more about the decentralized Internet.
